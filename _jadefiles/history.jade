            | As a research and develpment intern at the Diabetes Research Institute, I co-designed and assembled a high perfusion device, using 3D CAD, 3D printing techniques and Python and MATLAB coding languages. I also completed a user-manual and code for a MATLAB progrram designed to measure sarcomere displacement in heart contractions.

          p
            | As a Software Engineering intern at the Applied Physics Laboratory I extended a Python package that parallelizes common data access workflows to allow for easy data transfer and analyses from different petascale databases through a single remote. I also developed a user web-based interface for a partner company using React-JS(front end) and FlaskApp (back end) to allow for easy big data access and data sharing between companies.

          p
            | I am currently a software engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory where I work with developing and maintaining a big-data storage cloud-based framework used to accumulate neuro TEM and SEM multidimensional image data. The service is estimated to hold 6 petabytes of data. I also contribute to the tiered architecture of an APL database by implementing AWS Glacier to store often unused data and automate neuroscience image data analysis processes using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
